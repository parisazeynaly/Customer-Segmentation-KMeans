Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that performs a customer segmentation analysis using the K-Means Clustering algorithm. The project's goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on their spending habits and income, providing valuable insights for targeted marketing and business strategy.


Methodology and Approach
The analysis follows a robust data science methodology to ensure the results are reliable and meaningful.

Data Loading and Exploration: The project starts by loading the Mall_Customers.csv dataset. Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the dataset's structure, check for missing values, and analyze key distributions through plots like KDE plots and scatter plots.

Feature Selection: The analysis focuses on two key features: Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1-100). These features are crucial for understanding customer behavior.

Optimal Clusters: The Silhouette Score is used to programmatically determine the optimal number of clusters for the data. This data-driven approach confirms that 5 clusters are the most appropriate for segmenting the customers.

K-Means Clustering: The K-Means algorithm is applied to the selected features. The model groups customers into the identified number of clusters based on their proximity to the cluster centers.

Cluster Interpretation: The final step involves analyzing the characteristics of each cluster. The notebook provides a clear, descriptive name for each segment based on the average income and spending score of its members.

Key Findings: Customer Segments
The project successfully identified five distinct customer segments, each representing a unique customer profile:

Cluster 0: Moderate Income, Moderate Spender

Cluster 1: Affluent, Luxury Shopper

Cluster 2: Low Income, Luxury Shopper

Cluster 3: Affluent, Low Spender

Cluster 4: Low Income, Low Spender

These segments provide a clear and actionable framework for a business to understand its customer base and develop tailored strategies for each group.

Technologies Used
Python

Pandas for data manipulation.

Numpy for numerical operations.

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization.

Scikit-learn for the K-Means clustering algorithm.

Future Improvements
Incorporate more features (e.g., Age and Gender) to create more nuanced and complex customer segments.

Use other clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering) to compare results.

Develop a web application or interactive dashboard to allow users to visualize the clusters and filter the data.
